# \~ soft era \~

## **color scheme for [Discord](https://discordapp.com/)**

ðŸŒ¸ Light pastel syntax theme for soft, warm, cozy, cute chatting. ðŸŒ±

**notes:**

- must be using Discord in a browser
- browser must have a CSS override extension like [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html)
- _soft era_ currently only has a bright theme, so these overrides only work when Discord is set to Light appearance (dark mode to come)

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;make the world your kinda place.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;take care of the people around you
