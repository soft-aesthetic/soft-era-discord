# \~ soft era \~

**color scheme for [Discord](https://discordapp.com/)**

## to use this theme:

- must be using Discord in a browser
- browser must have a CSS override extention like [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html)
- *soft era* currently only has a bright theme, so these overrides only work when Discord is set to Light appearance (dark mode to come)
